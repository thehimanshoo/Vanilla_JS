jQuery Ajax
----------------

- AJAX is "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML".
- Asynchronous allows to perform the given task without blocking other tasks.
- JavaScript is used as a language for managing request and response.
- XML is Extensible Markup Language, used to transport data.
- It handles communication between Consumer and Provider.   


            Consumer => Client => Sends Request => XML Format 
            Provider => Server => Sends Response => XML Format 


- Ajax is used to define "Partial PostBack".
- It allows to design a page that can get new details and display without reloading complete page.
- It is good for designing SPA [Single Page Application].
- JavaScript handles AJAX by using "XmlHttpRequest" Object.
- JavaScript uses "fetch()" promise which handles AJAX calls.

    * Fetch has some problems that is :-
        a) fetch returns response in binary form.
        b) Convert binary into json().
        c) Poor in Security [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)].
        d) Poor in Error handling.

    - jQuery provides AJAX methods to handle request.
        * Advantage of usning AJAX.
            a) Returns data into JSON().
            b) Good Error handling.
            c) Issues related to CORS. (jQuery Ajax also have some issue but it is better than javaScript, and simple as well).

- jQuery Ajax methods -
    $.getJSON()             : Only for reading JSON files.
    $.ajax()                : for any types of content.

    Syntax :-
        $.ajax({ajaxSettings});

        ajaxSetting = {
            method  : "Get/Post/Put/Delete/Purge/Patch",
            url     : "Source_location",
            success : function(response){},
            error   : function(error){}
        }

        [
            Get     : It is for fetch the data.
            Post    : It is for submit the data.
